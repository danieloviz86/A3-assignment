Welcome to the home page for my first WEBD 162 class web site assignment!
The purpose of this web site is to [learn or refresh my skills] with HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to build and publish a simple 3 page web site. The following programs were used:
[editor or IDE name] to make web pages
W3C Nu Markup Checker to validate HTML
W3C CSS Validation Service to check Cascading Style Sheets.

The primary audience for this web site is the WEBD 162 instructor and class.
After visiting this web site, the audience will:
Know a little bit about me
Learn about my proposed final project web site topic
Have the opportunity to provide feedback on my proposed final project web site

Below are some informative images about this website:

Site organization

Web page template wireframe

Note: All the students in this class have similar web page structure using HTML for the assignment, but the content and styling of each student class assignment web site are unique.

Things will look pretty plain at first. I invite you to visit again and check out my progress!
